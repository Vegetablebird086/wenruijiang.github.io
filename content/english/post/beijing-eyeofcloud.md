### Duration
Dec 2022 - Mar 2023

### Project
A/B Testing Platform Development

### Overview
A/B testing is a method for comparing two or more versions of a webpage or app to determine which performs better, often used in website iterations, personalized content delivery, and user behavior analysis.

### Tech Stack
SpringCloud 路 MyBatis 路 MySQL 路 RabbitMQ 路 XXL-JOB

### Responsibilities

- **Backend API Development**:
  - Developed APIs to schedule and trigger A/B experiments via `xxl-job`, based on user-defined timing settings from the frontend.
  - Enabled dynamic control (pause, update, restart) of ongoing experiments through the job scheduling system.

- **Experiment Result Processing**:
  - Collected experiment results and fed them into a multi-armed bandit algorithm to calculate optimal traffic allocation, then updated website traffic routing rules accordingly.

- **Frontend & Integration**:
  - Integrated PDF export functionality for experiment reports via a webpage-to-PDF API.
  - Developed email-sending functionality to deliver PDF feedback reports to clients.

### Achievements
- Enabled automated A/B testing lifecycle management;
- Implemented intelligent traffic distribution for improved performance;
- Enhanced user experience with automated experiment reporting.
